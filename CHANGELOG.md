## [Unreleased](https://gitlab.heigit.org/climate-action/plugins/heating-emissions/-/compare/1.0.1...main)

### Changed

- Mapped emissions are now in vector (geoJSON) format, allowing better display and downloading of actual emissions data ([18](https://gitlab.heigit.org/climate-action/plugins/heating-emissions/-/issues/18))
- Expanded methodology with more context for non-technical users ([19](https://gitlab.heigit.org/climate-action/plugins/heating-emissions/-/issues/19))
- Simplified legend annotation to avoid capitalization typos ([15](https://gitlab.heigit.org/climate-action/plugins/heating-emissions/-/issues/15))
- Capped maximum values for color maps of per capita and absolute emissions ([25](https://gitlab.heigit.org/climate-action/plugins/heating-emissions/-/issues/25))

### Added

- Gridded maps of emission drivers: emission factor, energy consumption, and living space per capita ([26](https://gitlab.heigit.org/climate-action/plugins/heating-emissions/-/issues/26))
- Reference lines for histograms of per capita emissions and energy consumption ([10](https://gitlab.heigit.org/climate-action/plugins/heating-emissions/-/issues/10))
- Safety check and error message for AOIs without residential buildings

- Test for check_aoi() to see if it correctly catches AOIs outside of Germany ([16](https://gitlab.heigit.org/climate-action/plugins/heating-emissions/-/issues/16))
