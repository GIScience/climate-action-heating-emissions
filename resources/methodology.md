Residential space heating estimates are based on 100-m gridded data from the German census 2022.

First, we multiply population by the average living space per capita to obtain total living (i.e., presumably heated) space.
Next, we calculate the average heating energy consumption rate (kWh per m2) of residential buildings based on buildings' year of construction.
Finally, we calculate average carbon dioxide emissions per unit of heating energy (tonnes of CO2 per kWh) based on the proportion of different energy carriers in a given place.

Emission estimates are the product of total living space, average energy consumption rate, and average emission factor.
