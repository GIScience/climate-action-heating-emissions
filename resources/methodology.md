Emission estimates are based on 100-m gridded data from the 2022 German national census, and involve three steps:

1. multiply population by the average living space per capita to obtain total living space (i.e., the space that is presumably heated).

2. calculate the average heating energy consumption rate (kWh per m2) of residential buildings based on buildings' year of construction.

3. calculate average carbon dioxide emissions per unit of heating energy (kg per kWh) based on the proportion of different heating energy carriers (e.g., gas, oil, wood, district heating, etc.).

Emission estimates are the product of total living space, average energy consumption rate, and average emission factor.
