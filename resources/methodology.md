How much carbon dioxide do we emit when heating our homes? This depends on three main factors:

1. Heated area: how large is our home and how much of it do we heat? Do we live alone in a large house or do we share a small apartment? Do we heat the entire house throughout the cold season or only the rooms we use while we use them?

2. Energy efficiency: how much energy do we need to heat one square meter? This depends on how well insulated buildings are, but also on how we ventilate our homes during winter.

3. Energy source: how do we heat? Do we use a gas boiler, an oil furnace, a fireplace, or a heat pump? The source (or "carrier") of energy determines how much CO2 is emitted (and where) for each kWh of heating energy we use.

The 2022 German national census provides spatial information (on a 100-m grid) that allows us to calculate (or estimate) each of these key variables in any 100-m grid cell across Germany. The calculation involves only three steps:

1. multiply population by the average living space per capita to obtain total living space (i.e., the space that is presumably heated).

2. calculate the average heating energy consumption rate (kWh per m2) of residential buildings based on buildings' year of construction.

3. calculate average carbon dioxide emissions per unit of heating energy (kg per kWh) based on the proportion of different heating energy carriers (e.g., gas, oil, wood, district heating, etc.).

Emission estimates are the product of total living space, average energy consumption rate, and average emission factor.
