Estimate annual Scope 1 carbon dioxide emissions from heating residential buildings for any area within Germany.

Please note: the plugin provides Scope 1 emission estimates only, meaning that it estimates emissions generated directly at the buildings.
Emissions associated with electricity generation or district heating production are not included.
As a result, buildings heated with electricity or district heating are assigned zero emissions in our estimation, but there might be Scope 2 emissions.

More information can be found in the methodology introduction (by clicking 'Read about the methodology').
